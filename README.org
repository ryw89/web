* Deployment
The ~Makefile~ allows for easy building and deployment of this project.

To build and deploy locally and remotely, run: ~make app~.

To build and deploy locally only, set the ~NO_REMOTE~ environment
variable to any value. For example: ~NO_REMOTE=true make app~.

(Note that both of these deployment are for the ~.jar~ file and ~.js~
assets only and require a functional web server, e.g. Nginx.)
