Quick little tidbit about passing parameters to R Markdown files.

Using something like RStudio is great for dealing with R Markdown, but
sometimes you'd like to generate your output straight from the
command line. It's pretty simple to do that, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Rscript -e 'library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render("your-file.Rmd", "html_document")
#+END_SRC

Of course, ~html_document~ can be replaced with whatever output format
you desire.

Passing in parameters would look something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Rscript -e 'library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render("weights.Rmd", "html_document", params=list(some_param = "whatever", another_param = "something_else"))'
#+END_SRC

And then just make sure to have an appropriate ~params~ block in your
Rmd file. (This can go under the ~output~ block.)

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
params:
  some_param: ""
  another_param: ""
#+END_SRC

(Note in this example we're using empty strings as default values.)

And that's pretty much it!
